## Project plan

### Project description

To encourage walkers in Step It Up Highland walking groups to engage with digital technology, to develop their confidence in using digital technology and to use digital technology to tell their own stories. To use the stories produced by walkers to promote walking as an accessible way to self-manage wellbeing.


## Project milestones
A digital newsletter asking for expressions of interest was produced and disseminated in May and June
Five walking groups have been identified as our 'leader' groups.  They are already capturing their walks on mobile phones.  Some groups have sent us their work for uploading to our YouTube channel.
Our Tongue group have been inspired to become a 'leader' group as a result of submitting the image we now use as our profile image after a walk.
We will shortly add a link to our YouTube channel which showcases our work and also contains two videos prepared with the support of Paths for All which we will use to promote video volunteers at our upcoming regional networking meetings.
Future milestones:
We will be using the material created by our 'leader' groups at 4 upcoming regional walk leader meetings in November/December to encourage other groups to begin to use their phones/GoPro Camera to start to capture their walks and stories


## Evaluation

Although we are only part way through the project we have been able to use some of the material that we have captured, together with the videos prepared with the support of Paths for All, as evidence for a successful funding bid.  Being able to use the words of the walk leaders and the images of walkers socialising post walk created an impact that our written submission alone would not have done.  Whilst we initially undertook this project to support our volunteers and users to develop their digital skills and have the opportunity to capture their own experiences we did not, as an organisation, necessarily appreciate the impact that these stories would have when seeking funding.  It has certainly made us think differently when looking to either seek funding or to evidence the impact of the work that the organisation does as a whole.
